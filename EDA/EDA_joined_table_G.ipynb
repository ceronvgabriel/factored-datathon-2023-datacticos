       "[\"I picked Pokemon Y when this generation was released, and I am still playing it. I'm here for Charizard X.\\n\\nI'm also here to replay the story and side quests. I'm a late middle aged parent, and I've played pokemon from the Gameboy Color on up. This particular series has so much to do, and the IV checker makes the game a dream for people who like to hatch eggs.\",\n",
       " \"Great game overall, I liked how Pokemon from older generations were available right from the beginning. However, I feel that it is stripped of many features included in older games, such as: any form of contests, a clearly antagonistic rival, significant post-elite 4 gameplay, difficulty, and a logical plot line. I miss the contests from Gen 3, because they added an element to experience after you've beaten the elite four. Also, the island that you unlock upon beating the elite 4, has only one type of challenge. The side characters are completely one-dimensional, and Lumiose City doesn't make sense to me.\\n\\nThat being said, the massive improvements in online capabilities is truly exciting. The game makes it very easy and quick to trade or battle with players around the world.\\n\\nIn the end, the game is passable for a game in it's sixth generation. If you grew up with the older games, you may be disappointed at some aspects. If you are playing Pokemon for the first time, it should be great.\",\n",
       " 'This game is absolutely amazing! I have played every generation (and possibly version) of Pokemon since the series started and have never been disappointed, but Pokemon X may have just raised the bar! The graphics are stunning and the game-play is just as wonderful as the other generations, if not more so. The ending of the game is heartfelt and touching, and there is nothing about this game that I would make me stop playing it for hours on end.\\n\\nPokemon Amie and the Super Training allow you to bond with your Pokemon and train them to your own specifications, not those of the game. Pokemon Amie also allows you a unique look at your Pokemon, and even the oldies (Charmander, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Pikachu, Riolu, etc.) are perhaps even cuter than ever! I did notice that Riolu, if you tilt your head from side to side while in Amie, will mimic your movement and ask you to make faces with it! So cute!\\n\\nI returned to Pokemon Black 2 for about five minutes and was kind of disappointed despite myself. The differences are that great!\\n\\nI think the one and only thing I would change about this game is this: to add only one Pokedex feature from the previous generations, and that is the Habitat List from Pokemon Black 2 and White 2. It made it a bit easier to tell what Pokemon I had and had not caught, but after a quick Excel Spreadsheet on my nearby computer, that was hardly an issue anymore.\\n\\nFor anybody who loves Pokemon already or anybody who wants to try it for the first time, this is definitely the game to get! Pokemon X is definitely my new top-favorite in 3DS gaming.',\n",
       " \"It would seem pokemon is starting to really get easier an easier to play & beat, whatever happened to the old ways where we worked for something an felt like we earned it? Now it's like their just giving players the simple life.. an that wasn't what this was all about..\\n\\nMake a kids version & the gamer version next time, no one likes watching their games get downgraded to PBS level >.>\",\n",
       " 'Out of all the Pokemon games I own and have played, Pokemon X (and Y) is amazing! Probably the first time I interacted with other people around the world. This game is definitely worth getting!',\n",
       " \"If you've played the last 5 generations of Pokemon - including the multiple iterations and remakes - then you should know by now that there really isn't much to go over here. The graphics are nicer and they've added new Pokemon, but not much has changed beyond that. Despite being on the 3DS, we're still not working with a fully 3D environment yet. Instead, they just take the 2D over-world and tilt the camera angle a bit to make it appear less flat. They've added some new pointless and unexciting mechanics like riding Pokemon and Horde Battles (battling 5 Pokemon at once). Nothing revolutionary, of course. Some of it is even just flat out unenjoyable like Super Training, a way to boost your Pokemon's stats by hitting a button over and over again.\\n\\nSince Black and White actually introduced characters and a plot ever so slightly different from the mainstay, I was hoping this game would actually give us some kind of story. Nope. You're still a 10 year old kid who sets out with annoying friends to collect gym badges. This time the evil team's name is Team Flare, and their villain is a huge step back from N and Ghetsis as far as character development goes.\\n\\nThe Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and Champion are all ridiculously easy. Pokemon has never been known to be a challenging series but you can just steamroll through everyone in this game.\\n\\nThere aren't any memorable locations that come to mind. A lot of rehashes actually, i.e. Virdian Forest 2.0; Team Flare's underground base with teleporters and tiles that whirl you across the floor in one direction; a frozen cave which consists of puzzles based on sliding across ice floors (sound familiar?). As I write this all out it makes me realize just how sadly lazy Gamefreak is....\\n\\nTwo stars might be generous given all my bashing, but the 3D models of each of the Pokemon look gorgeous. The only actual portion of the game to take advantage of the 3D aspect of the 3DS is within a Pokemon battle, but the Pokemon do look damn good nonetheless.\\n\\nThey've also made some slight, slight changes to improve the competitive aspect of the game, such as preventing weather from being permanent and introducing Fairy type to combat Dragons. It's still terribly balanced, though, and you won't care if you're just going to play the main game and not competitively.\\n\\nIf this is your first Pokemon game, by all means play it and have a blast. If you've been playing Pokemon since Red/Blue/Yellow, then you won't really see anything you haven't seen (five times) before.\",\n",
       " \"Although it took me a while to get this game... I have recently finished it, and I love it. I'm 24 and I've been playing Pokemon since I first got Pokemon Blue on GB Color... and this is, by far, my favorite game. Pokemon Amie, the ability to customize outfits and hair, Fairy Pokemon... and the 3D. I'm not a huge fan of Friend Safari, but overall, even after finishing the game I am still fully involved in the game's activities. (Also, the cutest Poke Professor yet ;D)\",\n",

The new Pokemon are interesting and diverse, and the new Fairy type is definitely complimentary to the series as a whole.  The largest change overall is probably the graphics.  Normally, graphics are low on my list of important things, but this game is gorgeous with only minor issues when battling in 3D (there\\'s some slowdown).  The unique features for each individual Pokemon, from Braixen\\'s wand being used for special attacks in its animation, to Pikachu entering the battlefield with a quite prominent \"PIKA!\" are completely complementary to the gorgeous faux-Paris setting.  There are cafes and boutiques everywhere which give you a real sense of customization that doesn\\'t feel phoned in.  I strongly recommend this title, especially to Pokemon fans.',\n",

       " 'I have been waiting to see the new 7th generation Pokemon game. While playing I discovered that there were only seventy new Pokemon. While the game has nice 3d graphics and the option to customize your character, the game overall was lacking. I beat X in about 16 hours, to discover there was not a lot to do post game. The only thing you unlock is a place called Kiloude City, which is the Battle Frontier equivalent. There was one 7th generation legendary to catch post game. There is no 7th generation fleeing legendary Pokemon, instead you get to catch the legendary bird trio. This game may be great to new comers,  but for us who have been playing the entire series, Pokemon X is lacking.',\n",

       " \"My very first Pokemon game was a copy of Pokemon Red that i received when I was in 6th grade back in 1999. I enjoyed that game wholeheartedly and I have pretty much owned every pokemon game since (with the exception of crystal and emerald). I am still biased in my loyalty to the earliest generations of Pokemon since that is what I grew up playing. I've had my favorites from the newer generations that I love to catch and use (Sceptile and Groudon from III, Garchomp from IV) but overall I feel that each generation of new pokemon seems like the designers are running short of good designs. However, Pokemon X and Y have blended old and new in addition to vastly improving the gameplay experience to make these games terrific.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, I love the new 3D battle simulations. They really provide a more realistic experience to pokemon battles. Second, I love getting to see some of my favorite Pokemon from the early generations. I hated that Pokemon Black and White left all the old pokemon out until you beat the game, which is why those are my least favorite games. But X and Y really made up for it by allowing me to use my old favorites like Alakazam, Butterfree, and especially Charizard!\\n\\nI haven't used some of the online trading features yet but I hear that they really enhance the gameplay experience and allow the ability to obtain all sorts of different pokemon to help complete the formidable task of completing the Pokedex.\\n\\nOverall, I don't think I have ever enjoyed playing Pokemon this much before. Nintendo really hit a home run with these games. And upon hearing that they will be remaking Ruby and Sapphire with this generation, I am thrilled and hoping to experience these great new features on classic older games.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, DON'T WAIT!! BUY ONE OF THESE GAMES NOW!! Old and new players alike will find themselves addicted to the superior gameplay!!\",\n",
       " \"I can sum this game up in three words: It is AWESOME! So far, I've only gotten one badge, but this is just such an amazing game that I have to review what I've seen so far. Visually, it's stunning. The graphic style reminds me of Pokemon Colosseum and Colosseum XD, except with a camera that sometimes moves when you're walking around. Permanent berry trees now appear in-game, and, as if that isn't enough, you can grow berries at a huge berry field, too! There are at least a couple of mini-games to play with your Pokemon, which I enjoy greatly. Even the battles are more interesting with new additions like Swarms and an upgrade to the Exp Share (which is now a key item that shares EXP with your WHOLE TEAM at once, when switched on). TMs are still infinite use. The trainer PR videos are highly customizable, as are your trainer's clothes and looks. I know I've only seen the tip of the iceberg in such a massive game, but I cannot recommend this game enough. It's literally the best game I've played all year!\\n\\nSigned, Pamela\",\n",
       " \"I played this so many times, restarting and going through the game numerous time with a different team. This is probably the only Pokemon game where I actually kept a party of 6 Pokemon and used all of them, even battled the elite 4. I love the wonder trade, I got some cool Pokemon in most of my playthroughs and even my replay's. The graphics were beautiful, the gameplay was very good too, I love that you can kinda customize your character, you're no longer just the default character, that's the best part to me, it made you feel like you were part of the game, like a real Pokemon trainer. You can change your skin color, your hairstyle, clothes, and whatnot. Also, the Pokemon bank was a nice touch. I place where I can store all my Pokemon that I caught over the years and I got to see them in updated graphics, no still pose. That's awesome! My only issue is sometimes the camera angle in some tight places can be a pain, and after the elite 4, there's nothing else to do (which is partially why I replayed the game), but I overlooked them because it's a small flaw on an otherwise impressive game.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this as a gift, but has my own copy of it as well. I grew up playing Red, Yellow, & Blue. I was a diehard fan of the games and bought all of them since I was like 8 years old and now I'm 23. My favorite was Soulsilver because it was a remake of what I already loved the most. I actually hated the Platinum, Black, Black 2, etc. series. The new Pokemon were and still are pretty stupid to me at times, not all of them, but a lot are. The gameplay for Black & White was way too easy and baby-like for me. I didn't have high hopes for X/Y, but the fact it was the 3DS and friends told me it was great I had to try it and it's honestly my favorite now. They finally added features I've been wanting since I was 8 and the gameplay is interesting and keeps you going. I bought Y as well just to go through it again! The online features are amazing as well! I love to trade with strangers most of all so I can get Pokemon I can obtain otherwise!\",\n",
       " \"Ive played nearly every generation of pokemon starting with the original red version when I was a little girl. This is easily one of my favorites. The game is fast paced from the start, lacking the over abundance of handholding that plagued some of the more recent generations.  You pretty much recieve your pokemon and hit the ground running. The starters are a powerful set with interesting secondary types, the new fairy type is solid and a fun addition to gameplay, and mega evolution is pretty neat also.  I'd also like to give a huge shout out to wonder trade, which lets you pick a pomemon and trade it randomly with someone else using wondertrade from anywhere in the world. I have recieved pokemon from japan, germany, south korea, france, mexico, brazil, and many other places. I have gotten starter pomemon, late game pokemon, and even one shiny on it, and i now go out of my way to breed quality starter pokemon to throw on it to improve it's quality and make it more fun for everyone. With the combination of wondertrade and the gts, I have easily been able to assemble a colection of every starter pokemon from all 6 generations, and have fun distributing them to newer players.\\n\\nAnyways, all in all it's a great game, especially if you love pokemon aready, but it's still great for a newcomer as well.\",\n",

       " 'Arrived within it\\'s time-frame in a package much larger than was needed to hold a CD as seems to be the new thing for Amazon these days. I wonder if that is where our Prime dollars are now going? This was the number one request on my 12-year-old daughter\\'s Christmas list this year, so she was over-the-moon when she opened it. From what I can gather, it has lived up to her expectations. She talks about it all the time, going into quite a bit of detail that I do not  understand or follow, but it obviously excites her tremendously because she will talk about it for hours, and play it even longer if I allowed her to. The graphics seem to be ... graphicy. There are Pokemon. You play with them. OK, hang on, I will bring in the expert.  This is what she has to say. \"When you play Red, Blue or Yellow, the graphics are manageable, but when you move up to Pokemon X, the graphics are AMAZING. You can see the Pokemon battle, and you can see the moves that they use. Like, if you use \\'dig\\', you can see them dig down. And if you use \\'fly\\', you can see them fly up. And \\'greninja\\', when it uses my favorite move, water shuriken, you can see it throw the shurikens however many times the move hits, and it can hit up to five times. So you just see the shuriken fly at the opponent and it looks really cool!\" About the game she says: \"It is a really fun game. You start off in a town where your mom is a famous Rhyhorn raiser and then you find that Professor S. decided to pick you and four other people to become a Pokemon trainer.\" (Oh, so your Ash!) \"So there are three starting Pokemon. There is the Grass Type Chespin. The Fire Type Fenniken. And the Water Type, Frokie.\" (She chose Frokie). \"There is a bad team that you have to defeat.\" (She can\\'t remember their name, among other people you have to battle.) \"One of the coolest parts I think to the game is that you can Mega Evolve Pokemon.\" (Whatever that means.) \"There are tons of different Pokemon that can Mega Evolve. And if you like the final evolution, it will go back to its form after it battles. There are a few like Charizard, Mew, and Venosuar that Mega evolve, so Charizard will Mega Evolve into Charizard X, who is black with blue flames coming out of it\\'s mouth. Mew X - and tons of other ones like Aerodactlye, and the two fossile Pokemon that are exclusive to X and Y that can\\'t Mega Evolve yet, but they are very cool. It was hard for me to decide between them. But in the end I picked Amora. Once you get toward the end, you can catch the legendary Xerans, which I haven\\'t caught yet, but I really want to. I haven\\'t gotten that far yet. In the previous Pokemon games I have played, the gyms are basic and simple. But when I went up to Pokemon X, all the gyms are just SO COOL. My favorite gym so far is the Psychic Type Gym. It\\'s like a big Sphere Maze. You have to locate the gym leader. There are a whole bunch of different trainers that you don\\'t have to battle, but you get so lost you end up having to battle them.\"  That\\'s it for her review. If you have questions, she will be happy to answer them. I\\'ll be happy to pass them along because I know nothing.',\n",
       " 'I bought a 3DS a few weeks before this came out, my first portable game console in a long time, and figured I should see what all the fuss was about.\\n\\nWow, was I missing out!\\n\\nI always used to love RPGs growing up as a kid -- Final Fantasy 7 was my favorite game ever growing up -- and that always steered me away from the Pokemon franchise, weirdly enough. I both was suspicious of Pokemon ever being able to have a worthwhile story, as well as feared the constant grind of most RPGs.\\n\\nWell, I was pretty much wrong. I say pretty much because Pokemon\\'s story is actually oddly appealing -- you\\'re playing a character who\\'s out to Catch \\'Em All. So, no, it doesn\\'t have much of a real \\'story\\' per say, but it\\'s all just goofy fun, so where I was wrong was in thinking it needed to be something it isn\\'t and shouldn\\'t be.\\n\\nWhat I was really, really wrong about was the fear of grinding. The \"catching them all\" part of the game has made grinding fun again! It\\'s not constant battles everywhere, even where you don\\'t want them, to get pointless levels. You\\'re the one seeking out the battles -- and not for pointless levels, but to find the new Pokemon. The world keeps things fresh, so you never find yourself lingering in the same place too long, and there\\'s oodles and oodles of goofy side games to keep yourself occupied when you feel you need a break from catching your Pokemon... and would rather spend time \\'getting to know them.\\'\\n\\nI\\'ve talked about how much goofy fun there is in this game, but it does take very seriously the heart of this game, what makes it all work: it\\'s mechanics. The combat system is a deceptively deep turn-based combat system. There\\'s tons of strategy involved and, for someone who enjoys meta as much as I do, a whole bunch of tough choices to make. That said, it would be hard to get those decisions so wrong that you\\'d ruin a Pokemon -- but even if you did, for whatever reason, all you\\'d have to do is catch more.... or even breed them.\\n\\nTo put all of this in perspective, I went from being a deep skeptic of this entire franchise a month ago, who decided to buy the game as an experiment, to a full-throttled Pokemon addict who\\'s put 20+ hours on this game... when I thought the days of me having the patience to play games for hours and hours was long since at an end.

The 3D aspects of the Game are AMAZING! A totally different point of view. Sometimes though it will change the camera angle for you. But you can not change the angle so it might be difficult to move. I love how you can feed your Pokemon and play with them. You can also Change the way you look which I love as well. The Mega Evolution feature I like. I love how it makes the Pokemon Stronger.

       " 'I would consider Pokemon X (and even Pokemon Y to similar extents when I get it in the mail) one of the best Pokemon games to play.\\n\\nA departure from the series is the pixel sprites that made the world. Now games are in 3D and have not disappointed me. I enjoy drawing fan art of Pokemon and prior to the advent of this game and its companion, I\\'d usually have to rely on pictures from the anime and manga, which I am no longer fond of. Now that the Pokedex shows a 3D model when a Pokemon is caught, I can actually draw fanart of Pokemon at different angles beyond front and back.\\n\\nYou can actually change your avatar to suit you as your are ask for your gender, your looks and your name. However, the skin color for the darkest skin type for looks is still a dark taupe color. It\\'s still a start and quite a departure from playing what is a essential a white-skinned protagonist.\\n\\nSome items have changed, particularly the plates that are to be attached to Arceus, which include the Pixie Plate which corresponds with the new Fairy element type. The biggest change of all is the Exp. Share, which first started out as Exp. All in the very first games, giving all Pokemon in the party Experience Points, and later Exp. Share, giving  a selected Pokemon in that party a share of the points. For this set of games, the Exp. Share has reverted back to the properties of Exp. All.\\n\\nI have very few complaints involving the Lumiose City. Before I bought the game, I was well aware of a glitch that prevents moving around if saved in the North and South Boulevards and the two Avenues from The South Boulevard leading to the Central Plaza. Pokmon\\'s official X & Y Site recommend you save your games in a shop or better yet, in the Pokemon Centers. The Evolutionary stone shop in Lumiose City, to my knowledge, only sells Fire, Water and Leaf Stones, so evolving Eevee and Pikachu would require a debate on your self if you\\'re trying to complete the Pokedex as I only received one Thunderstone. You will encounter Pokemon from all 6 generations, some from the previous 5.\\n\\nOverall, the story did not disappoint. I won\\'t tell you the ending, but the game does leave many characters involved open for debate and fan theories of their beings and pasts.\\n\\nThe ending, however, simply doesn\\'t just go to the credits right after beating the Champion, it involves a Pokemon battle with an enigmatic character who is involved with the story\\'s backstory. After that, the cut scene that ties up the loose ends enough to satisfy those who held on long enough and then the credits, which has a song involved from the second part of the credits, subtitled in English and French. The music in the credit reminded me of the song \"Hana wa Saku\" (Flowers Will Bloom), created by the NHK, Japan\\'s public broadcasting station for the recovery of the Tohoku region.\\n\\nI have been told that Pokemon Y has a darker, more sinister story to its programming. However, I can say that Pokemon X is not that much different from the description for Pokemon Y from my experiences.\\n\\nAs for educational aspect: Mathematics are part of figuring out how much damage you deal to your opponent. Logic involving Rock-Paper-Scissors like deduction is involved when in a battle. Life lessons are involved with the story, such as the lengths one would go through to take back what was lost and the cost of the war from a non-monetary aspect.\\n\\nIt is a fun game to play. You might even beat my record of entering the Hall of Fame in 3 days after starting a game.',\n",
       " 'I would say Pokemon x/y have dethroned Pokemon Emerald but there are a few issues from a programming standpoint that make me lean more towards a 4.5/5.\\n\\n  First of all the battle scenes have a bit of lag and MIGHT* run at about 25-27 fps which is just below fluid.  When you turn on the stereoscopic 3D the frames drop to maybe 20fps during attacks, the only way to combat this is to have the attack animations and 3D turned off but in general as long as you keep the 3D off it should be good enough for most people...barely.\\n\\n  The 3D option is completely stripped in double and triple battles as well which is probably for the best as peoples 3DS\\'s would be crashing left and right.\\n\\n  My only other problem is the movement takes some getting used to, they added horizontal movement so the older players may have trouble getting accustomed to it, the controls are also on the loose side so you may accidentally fall off a couple (rollerblade areas) speaking of rollerblades, you are given a pair within the first hour or two of gameplay and they are superior to the bike in maneuverability so that\\'s a plus.\\n\\n  Now on to the positives.  The pokemon selection is excellent and there are some old favorites returning and the new ones are generally attractive in comparison to the last generation.  I have noticed that Gamefreak have taken more of an avante garde approach to the designs and many will find them interesting.  For instance the starter bug pokemon evolves into a butterfree clone but it actually looks BETTER than what it is copied from, also there aren\\'t as many useless pokemon in general this time around and the stat allocation is a bit more streamlined.\\n\\n  The overworld looks great but in some ways I miss the \"god\" view from above as it gives you a better look at your surroundings, still I think they did a good job on it and it\\'s growing on me.  The online trading/battling system is pretty well done, the \"wonder trade\" feature is basically gambling, I\\'ve gotten terrible pokemon most of the time but I have also recieved 2 or 3 useful ones.  I just trade my duplicate pokemon with it and hope for the best.\\n\\n  The music is also pretty good and so are the towns.  The setting is sort of French I believe which is a nice change from the usual Asian/western locales.\\n\\n  In all seriousness though, if you have a 3DS you probably already own this game and if you don\\'t your missing out on the Torchic giveaway that ends in January.',\n",
       " 'I am quite disappointed, after ordering the game POKEMON X, received the empty box without the game, that penalty with my son because it was his birthday present. Package arrived without paper covering the box, which means that I have been cheated.',\n",
       " 'I ordered this for my son over the weekend, and it said it would be here by Friday. Well I get home from work today and its already on the pourch, and I am just so excited, my son is excited because its here early; and I let him open it, just to find a cover less box with nothing inside. Needless to say, not my son and I were very disappointed.',\n",
       " \"What a shame. X/Y is not a horrible game, but left much to be desired.\\n\\nX/Y's story is poorly paced with several heavily underutilized characters. A shame because had the execution been better it would've been pretty good. Not that Pokemon has ever been amazing in that department, but after Pokemon Black/White 2, it felt like it took a 180 and felt very unsatisfying. It's still a better story then say Gold/Silver though. Team Flare is also easily the worst Team of any Pokemon game to date. A new level of stupid and boring, really.\\n\\nKalos itself is not very interesting as a region. I wasn't a fan of the extravagant French vibe going on. Lumoise City successfully captured the vibe of a bustling central capital better then any Pokemon game to date although packed with many utterly useless cafes. The biggest con of Kalos though is that all the routes felt extremely short and uninteresting, more so then any other Pokemon game. Maybe Gamefreak thought they could compensate for that with a huge amount of Pokemon to be captured in this game alone and maybe that does to some people I guess. I don't know about you but routes should be their own little journey and you should felt a twinge of excitement reaching the next town. I can name just three places where dungeons/routes had any actual length and two of them are near the end of the game or optional end-game content.\\n\\nLack of post game content is another really big negative point here, probably the most disappointing. After Black/White 2's packed post-game, it left much to be desired. You've got the Battle Maison, which itself is fun, but...that's it really it. Capture a few legendaries, of which don't exactly count in my eyes except one. The Friend Safari is another interesting end-game feature, but felt gimmicky to me and doesn't exactly make for long-term content. The Looker missions, which are short and have no replay value. It's quite evident Gamefreak tried to shoe-horn everyone into competitive battling as the main post-game content.\\n\\nThat's it really. It's far from my favourite Pokemon game, but what it does right it does well (Online features, 3D, Pokemon Amie, Super Training and trainer customization) and it is still a good introduction to Pokemon. If you're obsessed with Catching Them All and competitive battling you'll feel right at home here, everyone else will play it, put it down and probably not pick it up again.\",\n",
       " \"Pokemon in 3D for the first time since Pokemon: Battle Revolution and Pokemon Stadium. Only, it's 3D battling all the time. The overall story of the game is a bit darker compared to other Pokemon games in the series, but it's highly unlikely that most children who would be playing the game would understand a lot of the dialogue, and it's true intent. To them, it will be them stopping the bad guys, and collecting awesome pokemon along the way.\\n\\nThis game is perfect for the Nintendo 3DS and it's strongly recommended you pick it up!\",\n",
       " \"If you like Pokmon and RPGs, buy this without hesitation. I've played well over 100 hours at this while I beat the game may 30 or 40 hours ago at this point I am still catching and evolving Pokmon just to fill up the Pokedex and out of curious fun for these creatures.\\n\\nThe story and dialogue is standard, with quirky lines and the usual coming of age story. That has never really driven the game forward for me though. The search for discovery and solving some puzzles is where it is at for me with these games.\\n\\nAnother great Pokmon game!\",\n",
       " 'If you haven\\'t played Pokemon since Gold/Silver/Crystal, this is a good jumping in point. In fact, I\\'d say this plays so much like Crystal it\\'s scary.\\n\\nLike in Crystal, you can grow plants (in this case, berries) to help ease the item burden a little and save money. Also like in Crystal, there are many shops, knowing where the vending machines are will save you some serious money, and there are various shops and activities that are around only certain times of day. Much like in Crystal, the plot is very straightforward making it easy to get through the game without getting lost. It\\'s also possible to rematch trainers at higher difficulties and there\\'s even a groomer (even if they only groom Furfrou). There are a few improvements, however!\\n\\nIf you accidentally KO a \"single time\" pokemon like Snorlax or Xerneas, you will get second chances to catch them. Pokemon stats can be boosted by \"super training\"- a free activity done on the bottom screen via the new \"PokemonAmie\" system. PokemonAmie also allows you to make a cute room for your Pokemon to hang out in and to play with your pokemon, which makes them happy. Happier pokemon fight better! Trading is easy via the online system and the Battle Maison and Cafes are great for learning Triple, Double and Rotation battles while earning valuable items. If you have a friend you battle (and beat) a lot the system automatically adds a handicap to make it more fair. There\\'s also real-time animation day and night effects and the ability to dress your trainer up. There\\'s something beautiful about watching the sunset glisten off the water while playing with your pokemon.\\n\\nAll in all Pokemon X is a great way to get into pokemon even if you\\'re an old hand at it! It\\'s simple with tons of customization options and familiar enough that old players will feel that lovely nostalgia as they play. Happy training!']"

I'm a late middle aged parent, and I've played pokemon from the Gameboy Color on up. This particular series has so much to do, and the IV checker makes the game a dream for people who like to hatch eggs.\",\n",
       " \"Great game overall, I liked how Pokemon from older generations were available right from the beginning. However, I feel that it is stripped of many features included in older games, such as: any form of contests, a clearly antagonistic rival, significant post-elite 4 gameplay, difficulty, and a logical plot line. I miss the contests from Gen 3, because they added an element to experience after you've beaten the elite four. Also, the island that you unlock upon beating the elite 4, has only one type of challenge. The side characters are completely one-dimensional, and Lumiose City doesn't make sense to me.\\n\\nThat being said, the massive improvements in online capabilities is truly exciting. The game makes it very easy and quick to trade or battle with players around the world.\\n\\nIn the end, the game is passable for a game in it's sixth generation. If you grew up with the older games, you may be disappointed at some aspects. If you are playing Pokemon for the first time, it should be great.\",\n",
       " 'This game is absolutely amazing! I have played every generation (and possibly version) of Pokemon since the series started and have never been disappointed, but Pokemon X may have just raised the bar! The graphics are stunning and the game-play is just as wonderful as the other generations, if not more so. The ending of the game is heartfelt and touching, and there is nothing about this game that I would make me stop playing it for hours on end.\\n\\nPokemon Amie and the Super Training allow you to bond with your Pokemon and train them to your own specifications, not those of the game. Pokemon Amie also allows you a unique look at your Pokemon, and even the oldies (Charmander, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Pikachu, Riolu, etc.) are perhaps even cuter than ever! I did notice that Riolu, if you tilt your head from side to side while in Amie, will mimic your movement and ask you to make faces with it! So cute!\\n\\nI returned to Pokemon Black 2 for about five minutes and was kind of disappointed despite myself. The differences are that great!\\n\\nI think the one and only thing I would change about this game is this: to add only one Pokedex feature from the previous generations, and that is the Habitat List from Pokemon Black 2 and White 2. It made it a bit easier to tell what Pokemon I had and had not caught, but after a quick Excel Spreadsheet on my nearby computer, that was hardly an issue anymore.\\n\\nFor anybody who loves Pokemon already or anybody who wants to try it for the first time, this is definitely the game to get! Pokemon X is definitely my new top-favorite in 3DS gaming.',\n",

       " \"If you've played the last 5 generations of Pokemon - including the multiple iterations and remakes - then you should know by now that there really isn't much to go over here. The graphics are nicer and they've added new Pokemon, but not much has changed beyond that. Despite being on the 3DS, we're still not working with a fully 3D environment yet. Instead, they just take the 2D over-world and tilt the camera angle a bit to make it appear less flat. They've added some new pointless and unexciting mechanics like riding Pokemon and Horde Battles (battling 5 Pokemon at once). Nothing revolutionary, of course. Some of it is even just flat out unenjoyable like Super Training, a way to boost your Pokemon's stats by hitting a button over and over again.\\n\\nSince Black and White actually introduced characters and a plot ever so slightly different from the mainstay, I was hoping this game would actually give us some kind of story. Nope. You're still a 10 year old kid who sets out with annoying friends to collect gym badges. This time the evil team's name is Team Flare, and their villain is a huge step back from N and Ghetsis as far as character development goes.\\n\\nThe Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and Champion are all ridiculously easy. Pokemon has never been known to be a challenging series but you can just steamroll through everyone in this game.\\n\\nThere aren't any memorable locations that come to mind. A lot of rehashes actually, i.e. Virdian Forest 2.0; Team Flare's underground base with teleporters and tiles that whirl you across the floor in one direction; a frozen cave which consists of puzzles based on sliding across ice floors (sound familiar?). As I write this all out it makes me realize just how sadly lazy Gamefreak is....\\n\\nTwo stars might be generous given all my bashing, but the 3D models of each of the Pokemon look gorgeous. The only actual portion of the game to take advantage of the 3D aspect of the 3DS is within a Pokemon battle, but the Pokemon do look damn good nonetheless.\\n\\nThey've also made some slight, slight changes to improve the competitive aspect of the game, such as preventing weather from being permanent and introducing Fairy type to combat Dragons. It's still terribly balanced, though, and you won't care if you're just going to play the main game and not competitively.\\n\\nIf this is your first Pokemon game, by all means play it and have a blast. If you've been playing Pokemon since Red/Blue/Yellow, then you won't really see anything you haven't seen (five times) before.\",\n",

Normally, graphics are low on my list of important things, but this game is gorgeous with only minor issues when battling in 3D (there\\'s some slowdown).  The unique features for each individual Pokemon, from Braixen\\'s wand being used for special attacks in its animation, to Pikachu entering the battlefield with a quite prominent \"PIKA!\" are completely complementary to the gorgeous faux-Paris setting.

       " \"I've had my Sidewinder USB Gamepad for 8 years, and without a doubt it is the most durable, efficient, and reliable gamepad I have ever seen.  Having grown up playing mostly console games I find using the gamepad for PC games has a much more natural feel than using a keyboard and mouse.  It has lasted through nearly 1500 hours of gameplay over the past 8 years and has only started to show its age in the last few weeks.  I've heard that Microsoft will begin relaunching the Sidewinder line and I can only hope that the USB Gamepad will be in the line-up.\",\n",
       " \"I've had this pad for a few years already.  I have never had a problem with any of the buttons not working or wearing out.  For $15 it's very durable.  I have tried other pads and none of them are as good as, in my opinion, this one.  It is very comfortable in your hands, and you just plug it in and play.  With some other pads the USB would fall out with just a tap, but with the SideWinder the USB stays in until you pull it out.  I only have two complaints.  First the top three buttons are smaller than the bottom three, so i accidentally pushed the wrong button sometimes.  Also, as is common with gamepads, the D-pad is round, so the directions aren't always precise.  Sometimes I'ld be playing Street Fighter or a fighting game and I'ld push down to duck, but it would read me pushing down and forward and i'ld take a hit.  It's still one of the best gamepads out there that i have tried.  If you can find it at a Wal-Mart it sells for about $15.  That's cheaper than most, and it's a good deal.\",\n",
       " 'This controller works perfectly to my experience. The drivers for it are already on most computers going back to windows 98, so you literally can just plug-in and play! This conroller is shaped-well with very well-placed triggers. The button layout is a bit large but one can get used to it; for 2-D games I cannot imagine a better controller.',\n",
       " 'nothing better for tight,precise control of lara croft.i have 4 of them all excellent for 3rd person games.my highest recommendation.my recommendation is only for this model.the 4 button on right side are junk,no matter who makes em.',\n",
       " 'The controls are very touchy but with some time and practice it will be good',\n",
       " \"I bought this controller at a wal mart about a year back (roughly) And it's been pretty good for the $15 I paid for it. Now that it's showing its age, the down button doesn't work so well, but I didn't expect it to last forever. Worth $15, but not much more.\",\n",
       " 'Don\\'t take the \"5 stars rating\" reviews in such consideration, because their owners don\\'t seem to play many diferent type of games. It\\'s directional pad is a COMPLETE JUNK. If you have emulators on your computer, like M.A.M.E, and usually play fighting games (Street Fighter, KOF etc...), FORGET it.\\nIt is also NOT recommended to play any other emulator games. PC games are also a hard task to do.\\nWhy?\\nSimply because the D-pad doesn\\'t work. It\\'s almost IMPOSSIBLE to make the moves work well.\\nThe one star I gave goes to all the rest (I mean the buttons and the design).\\nStay away from any gamepad from MS. They are the worst choice.',\n",
       " \"Like other reviewers I started with a Logitech Rumblepad and had no end of problems trying to configure it for different games, then half the time my PC couldn't find it on startup. I must have installed the drivers about a dozen times (they seemed to disappear off my system) before it went back to the store. I then came home with the MS Sidewinder, plugged it in...and I was off and running. The easiest installation possible, and no problems so far.\\nI would have given it five stars, but it is a little lightweight and feels a bit flimsy, but other than that, it has been a joy compared to the Logitech.\"]"
