      "Jaspin should be commended for telling the stories of these towns, even when the information concerning these incidents is scant.  Buried in the Bitter Waters serves as a reminder to its readers that racial cleansing in America took place throughout the country, not just the Deep South.  It also reminds us that much of the history of our country has yet to be told.  Selma, Birmingham, Memphis, and Montgomery are familiar names in the history of race in America.  Jaspin shines the light on towns like Corbin and Commanche, not to disparage them but to remind us that the racial clensing in America was widespread.\n",

I had sold the text back to my campus book store a few years ago, but have decided I will benefit from having a copy available to me over my development as a professional. The information within this text, specifically the theories described by Yalom, are also incorporated into the state licensure exam, so it is a good reference to have when studying for this exam as well.\n",

      "This book is greatly detailed for neophytes and medium-advanced practicioners of the group therapies as it explains a bit of the origins and evolution of every aspect of the group therapy but deepens much more on all the ways (including the personal suggestions) of conducting this kind of therapy. It has all the topics, selecting candidates for each group, differences between each group depending on its goals, lasting of it, ways of terminating the therapy and so much more.\n",
      "One of the best books I've bought on Amazon.\n",

      "I have used Yalom's Group Therapy book since my doctoral training in the early 90's. His work is timeless and it is clear he is an individual who understands the heart and the soul of our work.  I created and facilitate a 18 - 20 week Relationship Academy which is part didactic and part experiential. It is amazing to see the group dynamics play out as expected based on Yalom's work. I will often read from this text in the morning, so that my mind is prepared for the day. It often changes my perspective and opens my eyes to considering different interpretations of behavior and it encourages me to silence myself and allow the \"process\" to work. How very rewarding this is!  I don't see how serious group work can be done without Yalom's influence. Thank you so much for the updated text.

      "\n",
      "Cristal clear, authentic, proficient, interpersonal aproach. I read the book 10 - 12 hours per day, almost without pause. Useful in all paradigms. The therapeutic factors are : instilation of hope,universality, imparting information, altruism, corrective recapitulation of thr primary family group.  The comparative value of the clients'and therapists' views are very usefully presented. Working in the Here-and-Now, positive and negative catharsis ( with corrective interpretation),and the liaison with other books of professor Yalom, are only a few ideas of this great book. I recommand it for student, teachers and everyone interested in personal development.\n",

      "Fantastic book using an interpersonal/psychodynamic approach that will engage all group members by bringing topics back into the \"here & now\" with the group.  Yalom's writing is engaging and makes sense.  Great for clinical work, school counselors and community counselors.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've used this text for years in facilitating groups.  His writing in practical and relevant.  He helps the reader to understand the dynamics of group process.

The examples Yalom uses are extremely helpful and allow the reader to apply his concepts to real world scenarios.  As someone else put it, this is truly a 'bible' for group therapy. Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend this book for psychologists and other professionals new to working with group therapy. It's very comprehensive. However, it could have focused more on patients with more severe problems than out patients, which are used in most of the examples in the book.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thank you for your fast service and the quality of the book. In that you said it was a new book and it came as a new book. Unfortunately in the past, I've ordered books that they have advertised as \"new\" but came all beaten up and written in as well!\n",

      "I had to buy this book for a class and it was actually a fun and helpful read. There are great therapy techniques as well as behaviors to be aware of, personality types in a group, selecting clients, what to do in certain situations and much more! I recommend it to anyone interested in group therapy-whether joining a counseling group or facilitating one.\n",

      "Consistent with the history of Yalom and Group Process books, the current book is strong in theory and with practical translations for readers of all experience levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom is the master of group therapy....his work isn't the easiest to read but he is the master. If you are considering a field in clinical psychology then you will just have to deal with his lengthy book. Yalom has done extensive research and this is a great starter book for learning the ins and out of group therapy. It is also the kind of book that you will keep and refer to years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Yalom is obviously an intelligent individual who appeals to graduate students in psychology with little if no knowledge of group psychotherapy. In theory everything is wonderful, interesting, and exciting. In practice, well that is another story. It will be interesting to see how well one is able to translate the book into actual practice where the value and importance of any text becomes glaringly known. Having been a student and clinician and professor, I can attest to the bewilderment students experience when they begin running groups and this book is not one that a novice can fall back on to survive the trials and tribulations of leading groups. It is a good read, like Freud is a good read but needs to be viewed more in a historical sense rather than a practical sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom is necessary reading for all psychotherapists that will be conducting groups. While his theoretical orientation is more interpersonal and existential than most, it provides the necessary foundation to expand into the desired group therapy leader one in the profession will wish to become.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love reading Yalom. He makes group therapy concepts flow like a river. I would give this as a gift to every student of psychology, psychiatry, nursing, social work, that I know. Not having won the lottery, I am thrilled to have it in my own library.\n",
      "\n",
      "In The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy, Yalom identifies interpersonal problems as a central reason why people are in need of psychotherapy.  He illustrates Sullivan's use of the term \"parataxic distortions,\" and the role it plays in group psychotherapy.  Parataxic distortions characterize the individual's propensity to mangle their perceptions of others.  It appears in an interpersonal situation when one relates to another on the basis of a portrayal occurring primarily in the former's fantasy, rather than on authentic characteristics of the other individual.  According to Yalom, an effective psychotherapy group is one in which the primary focus is on the \"here-and-now.\"  In addition to recognizing one's parataxic distortions, concentrating on the here-and-now enables the patient to become more aware of how they interact with group members and can provide them with a more realistic view of how others perceive them.  This eventually leads to improvement in their interpersonal relationships outside of the group, which in turn addresses many of their reasons for initially seeking therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom offers therapists several useful suggestions.  In particular, he describes the most effective ways of handling \"problem\" patients (e.g. The Monopolist, The Silent Patient, The Characterologically Difficult Patient); the use of written summaries; therapist self-disclosure; the difference between long-term outpatient groups and short-term inpatient groups; and the importance of personal psychotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only criticism is that there are portions of the book that are somewhat repetitive.  A few of the case vignettes are repeated throughout the book and have been mentioned in other books of his, but I do not consider this to be a major drawback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only do Yalom's recommendations make sense intuitively, he cites research studies to support many of them.  I have read most of his books and have found all of them (including his fiction novels) to be both engaging and educational.  As a clinician, I find the breadth and depth of his knowledge of psychology, philosophy and literature, along with his creativity and insight, to be quite inspiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great book. If you are interested in psychotherapy, specifically group therapy and consider yourself a psychodynamic, this book is definitely for you! It's an easy read, long, but fairly easy to take in. I completely recommend this!\n",
      "\n",
      "This book has great information and many excellent examples to make all the skills more clear.  It is a must have!\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial reading of this book as part of my class for my Master's in Counseling Psychology, proved to be suprisingly delightful. Dr. Yalom tells it like it is. He really explains theory and then the practical applications. Not for the those that revel in esoteric words. This book is for those who really want to learn how to do successful Group Therapy.\n",

      "This book came in a timely manner..just like description and I am highly satisfied. Thankx\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom's book is supposedly the quintessential book on group therapy. He writes as a very intellectual and highly educated man who seems to really need the reader to venerate and appreciate said qualities. I have an excellent vocabulary, and appreciate learning a new 50-center here and there.  However, this book reads as if Yalom first wrote the book and then went back over the entire thing with a thesaurus and exchanged every possible word with a more abstruse, esoteric, or recondite word.  The result is a garrulously verbose text, which is not even written in APA.  Every citation has to be sought in the 83 page appendix of references.  This is the most tedious and boring book that I have ever had the pleasure of using as a doorstop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Book is very easy to read and so helpful.  I started running three support groups this year, and this book is like my Bible!  I go to it weekly as a reference.  Cleverly divided into sections to find your information quickly.  Highly recommended it if you will be running support groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom identifies the pros and cons of conducting group therapy in inpatient settings. He provides excellent advice about how to conduct group therapy in what is perceived by many to be a difficult setting in which to conduct group therapy. I refer to this book frequently and highly recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a tech on a psych unit, I am often forced to run groups with the psychos. It's me against them and they got me outnumbered. After reading this book, I went into my sesion with guns blazing. The nuts didn't know what hit 'em. read the book and be well armed.\n",

      "This is a great book to understand how to have groups and the steps in understanding how.\n",

      "This was a very helpful manual for Group Therapy.  It was a little lengthy in spots, but I would recommend it for anyone interested in improving their skills as a group counselor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom did a superb job in taking his readers through the process- the world of group psychotherapy. I especially appreciate reading about the cases to see how the theories actually came together. I have learned so much from a pro!\n",

      "i was very pleased with the product i ordered arriving on time and in the condition promised\n",

      "A real masterpiece! Astonishingly comprehensive, most excellently and lucidly written,interesting, profound, convincing, frank and open-minded, and contains, in my opinion, the best of group thinking and pracice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plain and simple, Yalom's seminal text on group therapy is a MUST for anyone wishing to perform therapy in this format. While he comes from a Gestalt standpoint, I feel he remains fairly objective in both his recommendations and observations from his experience. He does a good job at incorporating the latest research to back up his viewpoints as well. His examples are clear and thought-provoking, and he spells out everything in an easy to understand manner. He himself has said that he's more of a writer than a psychologist (and I believe him after seeing his therapy videos!). I learned so much from this book that I don't know where to begin. With every sentence came an \"a ha\" moment for me! *Note: Keep a highlighter in hand while you read.* Even though its breadth is fairly daunting (with almost 700 pages), Theory & Practice is WELL worth the read....and re-read. I've referred to it repeatedly throughout my experience running groups. Can't recommend this one highly enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've read a lot of Yalom's work and have been fortunate enough to find material by his wife. As a counselor who has worked in the trenches for over 23 years I appreciate his perspective, knowledge, wisdom and insight.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book never fails to deliver. While this is a lengthy tome of material to digest, I've found that it reads like a novel and left me feeling more hopeful as I came away with more insights, more skills, and a deep appreciation for the work I do and Yalom's contribution to the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope he continues to write.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yalom is ever the master on the topic of group therapy. This is of course, a must read for any novice in the area of group therapy. It is also, as I have discovered, an essential treasure chest for those of us who wish to improve our skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the fundamental book for anyone who does group work. For a therapist, a minister, any type of of leader or director. This book expertly describes how to deal with difficult members and provides the foundation for any  type of group.\n",

      "\n",
      "This book was a required reading for one of my classes at school. I am familiar with Yalom's work after he became an author of more popular literature (The Gift of Therapy, Love's Executioner, etc.) so I was half expecting this book to be written in the same style. It is written like a text book. At times, you can see Yalom's personality coming through, but most of it is dry and rather unemotional. However, this book is still edifying and (while not entertaining) easily read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time I pick up a Yalom book I ask myself why I have waited so long to read another one. His books are a pleasure to read and speak to people on all levels of experience and expertise. The title of this book says it all and is the perfect book for someone who will be working in an inpatient setting. This is a must-read for all professionals working with this population and speaks to the challenges and frustrations of this environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom has vast knowledge and experience with group therapy, and in this book he imparts it to neophyte counselors in a logical and detailed format.  He carefully explains the therapeutic value of a group, the factors necessary to facilitate change, and the role of the therapist.  He emphasizes the here-and-now focus, and how group members create a social microcosm of their life within the therapy group.  Yalom advises on practical matters, like the selection of clients and the creation of the group.  He then carefully explores the stages that groups move through, and some problem members that one could encounter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drawbacks of this volume include the length - it is excessively long (they could cut chapter 9) due to the verbosity of the author.  I had to look up several words and phrases that I was unfamiliar with, and I have to admit, some pages bored me.  Nevertheless, for a text, this is a great book.  I read every page, to the end, even the unassigned chapters.  I'll keep this in my library for reference, and I hope to be able to refer to it repeatedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an excellent book for group counseling practice. It provides lots of cases with comments and reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "A comprehensive text that is easy to read and comprehend. Very helpful for anyone planning to lead a group in therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "he's done it again...yalom has an amazing insight into human nature and the healing components of therapy of any modality. to fully appreciate this book, as well as his other works, you have to at least be okay with the notions of existentialism, as his conceptualization and methodologies are built on the basic premises of this theory. i have shared his works with intelligent and particularly introspective patients, and they really seem to relate to his notions. thinking outside the box is important to appreciating yalom, in my opinion, as he does not subscribe to standard cognitive-behavioral or psychodynamic notions. these are very important and useful approaches, but existentialism is a horse of a different color and encourages patients to consider themselves and the lives they are living in a different way. this book takes these important concepts and applies them to group therapy in a very practical way.\n",
      "\n",
      "this truly is the universal group therapy handbook.  it is extremely helpful for those practicing with long running groups.  the case studies provide excellent illustration of the concepts discussed.  it is a highly practical text with applications to both the group counseling realm, as well as the individual counseling realm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom's techniques are timeless, as long as human nature and how it plays out in social interactions transcends time and place.  Thus, decades after publication, this book of group therapy lives on, whereas others, more faddish, are either narrowly focused on sufferers of the \"disease of the year\", or, in the case of \"pragmatic\", short-term \"manual-based\" groups which insurance companies favor, assume that all one has to do is give the patient the right recipe and 8 weeks to practice it, and they'll be cured of life-long ingrained pathological behaviors.\n",
      "Anyone who thinks this book is \"out of touch\" or demonstrates a  lack of empathy by Yalom, probably has a pet style of group therapy, and an axe to grind. Often, seemingly more empathic therapists, run groups in which everyone takes turns getting sympathy, distress is \"validated\", whereas the patient's contribution to it is ignored, and the premise is that sufferers are misunderstood victims of a neglected disease who are finally in the hands of someone who \"gets it\".  Usually therapists who lead such groups, don't only wish to empathize, but are driven by a wish to feed their own vision of their specialness as the champions of the underdogs.\n",
      "One of Yalom's greatest contributions is the effectiveness with which he used the group approach to exactly show patients how they cause their own distress--by creating a group atmosphere in which members play out their poor social skills, and get the powerful impact of peer feedback on this.  He did so in a way which demonstrated genuine empathy in action:  by steering members to identify (and empathize) not only with each others' misery, but with each others' strengths.  Sympathy without a kick in the [...], is patronizing, and implies inequality.  Sympathy with a kick in the [...] (always best given by peers), is sympathy with belief in your power--this shows respect for all of you, your strengths and your miseries.  THIS is empathy.  THIS is what empowers group members to overcome their problems.  And this truth, will never go out of date.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is about time Yalom stopped expending his already out of touch books on group therapy. His first edition was an asset in the beginning development of group therapy but his many editions are just another way of selling books. In many cases his more recent editions give graduate students an unrealistic and often out of touch perspective on group psychotherapy. One only has to watch one of Yalom's group therapy videos to really see the detachment and lack of feeling this man produces in his work. The book was a bore but there will always be those groupies through cognitive disonance who will aplaud its great contribution. I feel sorry for the clients who come to their groups if they model themselves after Yalom. Sort of similar to all those Benjamin Spock babies running around after their mothers raised their kids by his book and are now completely neurotic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I read this book for one of my college courses (group therapy) and cannot express my gratitude for having come across this book. Mr. Yalom dissects and explains nearly all imaginable aspects of group process, from before the first meeting to well after termination. Beyond that, he provides wonderful insight into human behavior. This information is invaluable to me. I agree that it should be required reading for anyone seeking a profession in human services. Yalom is the man!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody should do group psychotherapy without reading this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am currently using this for class and it is a very good book. Yalom, explains the process of group work and what aspect of the process works and what doesn't. You will be able to use what you read in this book with your own groups. Expects some laughs because there's a lot of humor also. You won't be bored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Yalom's book is not only a veritable masterpiece, but a tour de force that deals with everything you ever wanted to know about group psychotherapy.\n",
      "Comprehensive without being pedantic, thorough without being dense, Dr. Yalom puts the group process under a magnifying glass and, in straightforward easy-to-understand language and conceptualization, gently guides the student through all of the subtlties and nuances of group work.\n",
      "I had to purchase this book for use as the main text in a group process course, but this book will remain on my shelf long after I have taken the course. Dr. Yalom's keen insight into not just how/why groups behave and function the way they do, but also his insight into basic human nature, has made this book very enjoyable as well as educational.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have used Irvin Yalom's text for three years as a companion to a process-oriented ten week group experience for undergraduate psychology students. The students have complained of Yalom's exceptional vocabulary and historical and literary allusions, but some have apparently managed to read the parcels I've assigned and have reported appreciating the wonderful vision and breadth of Yalom's novel-like presentation.\n",
      "I enjoyed this book immensely as a graduate student of counseling and have found it to be a wonderful resource. It has been very enjoyable to watch my students see Yalom's principles get played out in our demonstration group and it has been gratifying to see these forces affect my clients therapeutically even with the limitations of managed care. In fact, I would say that Yalom's existential leanings are very consistent with strength-based, solution-focused psychotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is one that every graduate student in psychology or beginning therapist should read and have on their shelf.  Yalom covers and discusses many important aspects of group therapy such as interpersonal learning, basic thearpist tasks, the idea of working in the here-and-now, therapist transference and transparency, selection of patients, creating a group, problem patients and training the group therapist.  Yalom addresses this book to new therapists just starting out, as well as therapists who have been in the field for some time.  Yalom presents the new therapist with the many considerations that need to be looked at when forming a group and actually leading a group and he assists the therapists who have been in the field for some time with ways in which to sharpen or improve their skills.  Yalom's book appears to be based on highly functioning upper middle class individuals who seem to have good jobs and relationships with their family, friends and spouses.  One may gather this assumption from the clinical vignettes and cases that Yalom presents throughout the entire book.  Yalom incorporates much of his own practical experience with individuals in the groups that he has led himself, which makes his book feel like you are reading a novel and not a textbook per se.  Although Yalom based his book on highly functioning upper middle class individuals, he never addressed the idea of group therapy with children or individuals of different ethnic backgrounds, which seem to be two important areas in today's society, especially within the realm of therapy.  Yalom incorporates a rigorous research base within his text, such as discussing some of the current treatment modes and the diagnostic criteria for managed care, which other authors tend to maybe leave out or not touch upon, in essence leading the reader to believe that what Yalom speaks about is true, factual and practical when referring to group therapy.  Although Yalom conducted an extensive amount of research on the area of managed care, I do not think it is possible for an individual to be covered by a managed health care or insurance company for a group that is conducted over a one to two year period, as Yalom presents in some of his clinical vignettes.  One thing that I think Yalom has done that other authors have not is present the reader with twelve variables that he refers to as \"therapeutic factors,\" (i.e. instillation of hope, universality, altruism, and group cohesiveness) which in essence are the driving tools and elements that assist therapy groups with rectifying individual character distortions.  Yalom's book assisted our graduate psychology class in gaining an immense amount of insight and depth into the area of group therapy in such a short amount of time.  Yalom's book is one that should be included in all graduate programs in psychology!\n",

      "Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy by Dr. Yalom is an excellent book from which to gain knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of group process and also and essential piece of literature to keep at hand as a valuable reference book. This is the book that should be part of the therapy room equipment. I found this book to be pretty comprehensive and well written. Each chapter unfolds in a refined, detailed, manner providing depth in understanding every step of the process of group therapy. Yalon goes beyond reminding us of the importance of the therapeutic environment to provide a safe and warm place to facilitate sharing and disclosing. He expands from his theoretical framework to explain group dynamics in practical, concrete, ways through the use of terminology from other philosophical views and perspectives. He also stresses the need for therapists to strive to create a therapeutic culture in which the group and individual members can begin to take the roles they play in their natural environments. His whole approach to the process of group therapy is existential emphasizing on the \"Here and now\" and focusing on what is going on in the immediate present of the group. Evidence of his existential approach can be seen throughout the book with his consistent theme of interpersonal learning, self-exploration, self-growth, and taking responsibility for changing one's behavior to enhance personal life. Yalon provides answers to the questions he anticipates his readers may have. Questions such as regarding the creation of a group, and probable problems encountered during the course of different phases of group therapy. He goes on to explain in a detailed, specific manner, different variables that may influence the success of the group. He also provides possible solutions to these problems and transmits to the reader a sense of faith on the success of the group, and the process of the group learning experience. An important aspect, that yalon neglected when writing this book, is cultural diversity. It appears that the results of the research mentioned in his book can not be generalized to populations other than white, middle class adults, who are at a certain intellectual level of functioning,  and who are motivated to work to change. Other than that, this book is an excellent resource book \"To keep and to hold till'...\" another better book comes along and  \"Do us apart\"..\n",

      "Yalom's book, The Theory And Practice of Group Psychotherapy, is written in such a way that a reader with a fair understanding of psychological theory and clinical practice can understand and utilize the material presented. As a student, I found the book extremely helpful as the material was presented in such a way that I will be able to use it in the future should I decide to practice group therapy; of which, I am interested. I found the structure of the book helpful as the table of contents led me through the book in a progressive manner that provided me with motivation to keep reading. This structure began with an overview of a study that presented what patients found helpful in a group therapy setting and the process through which this learning took place. Important topics, and why these topics are important, are thoroughly explained. Topics that I especially found important were \"the therapeutic factors\", interpersonal learning, group cohesiveness, working in the \"here-and-now\", transference and transparency, creation of the group, and the specialized formats and procedural aids for therapists. The benefit of being able to utilize the material in the future made the length of the book much more appealing. Yalom covers material that will help me start a group, move a group along and understand the dynamics of transference and how it works for a therapist if it is recognized and understood. In the future I may find that Yalom does not cover something that should have been included in the book but had not been, but as of yet I will be confident as a group therapist, or cotherapist, with the material covered in the book. This book, along with the education and training that I have had this year at my training sight and in practicum, have provided me with the tools that I will need to be confident as a beginning group leader and therapist.\n",

      "The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy is the first text I've enjoyed reading as a psychology graduate student.  Other texts have been useful and have provided me with knowledge.  This book did that and more,  it provided vignettes that brought Yalom's statements, research findings,  and observations to life.  The pages became practical as well as  meaningful. In the first 216 pages of this book, Yalom lays down a much  needed foundation of group psychotherapy for the neophyte therapist.  These  pages not only build a case for group work efficacy, but it gave the reader  a workable foundation upon which to build on. I enjoyed the practicality of  the chapters discussing the formation of a group.  From this a psychology  graduate student can easily delineate what a successful group would look  like, how often it would meet, for how long, and where to meet.  It is  self evident that Yalom has done extensive group therapy research, for he  did not provide concrete information with out backing it up with research.  I haven't read too many texts in which the author takes such effort to back  up his/her conclusions.  This book is jammed packed with practical  information and techniques a graduate student as myself can utilize when  beginning their first group experience.  Many details are included such as  getting supervision, the leader's role, techniques, and the use of  audiovisual tapes.  These details along with theory and vignettes create a  comprehensive and palatable resource manual on how to develop and conduct  an adult psychotherapy group.  However, there were a couple of topics  he left out.  Although, Yalom clearly indicates he does not approve with  the HMO movement of brief therapy, it is a reality.  He indicated that he  likes his groups to meet for 18 months. Neophyte therapist at internship  sites and post graduate sites are dealing with HMOs, college campus  psychological clinics, school based setting,  etc. and this length of time  is never an option.  He doesn't have to agree with such time constraints,  but  not address them is a disservice to novice therapists. The neophyte  therapist is clearly his audience in this book, thus it is important he  address the audience's needs.  He should know what is expected of us in our  profession.  What is often expected of us, is to work with clients within  eight to ten sessions.  I would have loved to receive practical ways of  conducting and modifying his approach to fit the time constraints that I  and other neophyte therapists face.  I work in a school based  counseling program. Many of the children are so emotionally and verbally  impaired, that I do not think they would provide the group with much, if  any, verbal material. I'd like to know how Yalom feels about child group  work and how he'd make the preliminary preparations and conduct sessions.  Children have very different capabilities and needs, and I would have liked  Yalom to address them.\n",

      "Yalom's revolutionary book is essential reading for the graduate student in counseling. It provides a comprehenive guide to the group experience, form the beginning to the end, and everywhere in between. It includes how  one would create a group, problems to expect and practical solutions to  these problems.  The book does not read as a typical textbook, but as a  novel. The authors style is informative but not laden with jargon. The high  readability is also due to the fact that Yalom includes real-life examples  throughout the entire book. This helps the reader to apply theory to  situations that will be encountered in the course of conducting group  therapy. Each chapter is outlined explicitly, which helps with future  referencing.  The most practical knowledge gained from reading this book  is the emphasis on the here and now process of group therapy. This is an  aspect often overlooked by new group therapist. The explanation of group  process demystifies the group experience and explains how groups are  beneficial to the members participating in them. This book is also  practical in that it gives an explanation of all possible pitfalls  encountered in the group setting, including problem patients and attrition  in the group. The author helps the reader to know what to expect and how to  handle problems  when they arise.  While this book was an extraordinary  guide to the group experience, there were a few shortcomings. First of all,  the book was based on outpatient groups that Yalom led and supervised at  Stanford University, which might not  be applicable to all of the  population. The reader is advised to take this into account when reading  the book. Also, the groups were all long-term, sometimes lasting several  years. In reality, this may  not be a practical occurrence, as therapist  may have trouble finding members that will commit themselves to such a long  term group.  There were two major aspects of group therapy that needed  more attention in the book. First, cross cultural issues were not  discussed. This is an extremely iimportant aspect of all therapy, and it  was not addressed here. It is questionable that all the results presented  in this book would apply to multi-cultural situations. In addition, brief  therapy groups were rarely mentioned in this book. in reality, therapists  will probably conduct homogeneous brief therapy groups much more often in  the course of their careers. The author included a chapter on the encounter  group that was popular in previous decades but is rarely used anymore. It  would have been more fruitful  to address the brief therapy group and omit  the encoounter group.  Despite these shortcomings, this book is of  extreme value to the new therapist. It includes all aspects of group  behaviior and answers the readers' questions before the are even asked. It  should be mandatory reading material for all graduate students before they  lead their first groups.\n",

      "Good book to have in your repertoire particularly when you are first learning about different types of therapy. Irvin Yalom is a gifted psychiatrist and writer.\n",

      "\n",
      "I purchased this book for my Group Therapy class as part of my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling Degree. I had never been exposed to group therapy before and quite frankly didn't understand the process itself. Yalom is kind of the \"guru\" on group therapy and this book is highly recommend in the therapy community if you are conducting any sort of group therapy. I cannot stress enough how important it is to read this book BEFORE conducting a group. It will give you techniques and certain things to say which will allow your group to process what is going on which will ultimately help your clients heal and teach them how to effectively interact with other group members. Additionally, they will learn how to use the skills they learn in group and apply them to relationships in their personal lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom's book The Theory and Practice of Group Counseling is a study of the process of group counseling. The research is somewhat dated because the copyright date in 2005, but it si comprehensive. The many examples make group therapy come alive. This book can be used as a text in a group counseling class or as professional reading for anyone who facilitates groups. I recommend it be updated with a copyright date of 2015..\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is entertaining to read, and it is not just another textbook. The author gives a lot of examples of what he is talking about, which helps to break up the information and to show precisely his point. I thoroughly enjoy this book, even though the size seems daunting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom's book is a classic in group therapy. It focus the core elements and process of group therapy and it is quite complet in content. But I found the book quite disorganized in presenting the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very thorough and dynamic book on group counseling!  If you want encouragement and feedback on the benefits and dynamics of group counseling, this book takes you through the process.  You'll come out of reading this brimming with newfound knowledge and confidence!\n",

      "You have to read it,and then you must practice!\n",

      "I highly recommend this book if you are in the counseling industry.  It tells all about group therapy.  I found it very useful as I worked on my Masters in Counseling.\n",
      "\n",
      "i ad to buy this book as it was required by my professor, but there really is no practical techniques or theories that you can apply to group counseling.  This book is mostly theory based where you can find those same theories in the textbooks used in class.  The book is rather dry as well.  Not an interesting read at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book was written ages ago, but it is still useful. I don't much care for the history of inpatient group therapy, but the examples and suggestions helped me understand that inpatient group is limited and is for the purpose of getting them used to groups after they discharge into an IOP program. This helped be become a better group therapist. I lent it to so many people at my work that I never ended up getting it back.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one my favorite books! It is a such a comprehensive resource. It is one that I will use forever.\n",

      "Great book. Though it looked voluminous, it was quite light when lifted up, and the font size of the words made reading really easy and enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Group therapy is, in my opinion, a criminally neglected and underrated tool in the toolset of psychotherapy and medicine. Group reveals our attachment style and communication patterns with a clarity, efficiency, and force that no other form of psychological intervention can match -- every person on the planet should spend some time in a group dealing with his or her mental and/or emotional issues. The world would be a better place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Irv Yalom probably knows more about group than any other person, and this guidebook is essential to anybody wanting to understand the form. Yalom explains group thoroughly, in an understandable but frequently profound manner. The main drawback is that the book may even be overly comprehensive, and its length is likely to intimidate non-professionals, which is a shame because the benefits of group need wider dissemination.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is a fundamental tool for anyone working with groups. Yalom provides lots of excellent and descriptive case examples and excerpts from groups he has run in the past. I highlighted nearly every line on nearly every page. EXCELLENT book!\n",

      "34 days and still haven't gotten the book. It was a birthday present for my son on Oct 24 but as of now maybe he will get it for Christmas\n",

      "\n",
      "I am a graduate student studying counseling/clinical psychology.\n",
      "I bought this book for a Groups Dynamics class and I have really enjoyed it. However, Yolam does go over board with big unnecessary words the techniques and concepts are amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalom is the classic group therapy text. This text provides the foundation for a group therapy course in my teaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "This classic book on group therapy imparts useful information in an insightful and intelligent manner.  Yalom presents conceptualization in a way that expands my mind as a therapist and a human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "This really is the ultimate group therapy textbook.  It covers all your bases in regards to group therapy as an overall framework, and is actually pretty easy to read.  The author is very engaging, and provides multiple helpful examples and idea.  I know many people who have read this book multiple times and have no doubt I will be one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this book still remains to be a major text in the field, one could argue it offers keen insights into the functionings of the human in relationship toward other humans.  Humans, being social animals, such a text can serve as a practical guide on how and why we we interact as we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is plenty of theory and such for the dedicated psychology student, but one could make the arguement, wouldn't we, as a species, be better off and more advanced if every human studied and applied many of the principles in this book?\n",
      "\n",
      "I facilitate two addiction recovery groups:SMART Recovery and LifeRing on a voluntary basis.  This book is extremely helpful and insightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Yalom. What more do I need to say? His respect for the contributions of clients/patients to their own healing, and the healing of other persons in group context inspires me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is interesting and informative. Yalom is very good writer. I love his novels too. This book is very important for every therapist - beginner as well as expert!\n",

      "The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy by Irwin Yalom is on of the best books available on Group Psychotherapy. You will learn about group psychodynamics and how to move the group forward in a positive direction. This is a wonderful book for psychiatrists to read. It is very well written and easy to understand. I give it a 5 star Excellent rating. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL\n",
      "\n",
      "The book arrived at a good time. The book was also very great, mainly used for class. The Amazon rental service was horrible. I returned it before the due date to be posted in the mail and I see on my bank statement they charged the full price. And for what?! I might as well of bought the book full price.\n",
      "\n",
      "This book is reasonably priced for what you get. The beginning is about the 11 factors of group psychotherapy (basically, what takes part in a good group dynamic/experience). The middle discusses the traits of a therapist and other group dynamics. The end applies skills to practice. Pro: it expands your vocabulary; there are numerous examples; and it provides readers with skills. Con: at times it is extremely dry and wordy; and it only covers one theoretical framework (psychotherapy).\n",
